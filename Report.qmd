## Markdown

Markdown is a simple markup language that allows you to format text quickly and readably.

This is normal text.  
You can write in **bold**, *italic*, or ***both at the same time***.

You can also use ~~strikethrough text~~.

This is a bullet list
- Item one  
- Item two  
- Item three  

This is a numbered list
1. First step  
1. Second step  
1. Third step  

It is also very easy to include a [link to a website](https://www.ehu.eus).

And you can also embeb images in a similar way:

## Mermaid

To create an ER diagram with just entities and relationships:

```{mermaid}
erDiagram
  Customer ||--o{ Order : places
  Order ||--|{ LineItem : contains
  Customer }|..|{ DeliveryAddress : uses
```

But you can also include attributes with their data types:

```{mermaid}
erDiagram
    Customer ||--o{ Order : places
    Customer {
        string name
        string custNumber
        string sector
    }
    Order ||--|{ LineItem : contains
    Order {
        int orderNumber
        string deliveryAddress
    }
    LineItem {
        string productCode
        int quantity
        float pricePerUnit
    }
```

End even evolve into a logical design including keys and comments:

```{mermaid}
erDiagram
    Car ||--o{ NamedDriver : allows
    Car {
        string registrationNumber PK
        string make
        string model
        string[] parts
    }
    Person ||--o{ NamedDriver : is
    Person {
        string driversLicense PK "The license #"
        string(99) firstName "Only 99 characters are allowed"
        string lastName
        string phone UK
        int age
    }
    NamedDriver {
        string carRegistrationNumber PK, FK
        string driverLicence PK, FK
    }
    Manufacturer only one to zero or more Car : makes
```

## SQL queries

First, you should create a database connection:

```{r}
library(DBI)
library(RMySQL)

dbExam <- dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(),
    dbname = "Exam",
    host = "127.0.0.1",
    port = 3306,
    user = "student",
    password = "sql")
```

Then, you can include as many SQL code chunks as needed:

```{sql connection=dbExam}
SHOW TABLES;
```

...

Do not forget closing the connection when not needed anymore:

```{r}
dbDisconnect(dbExam)
```
